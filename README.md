üåü Excited to Share My Experience with Sentiment Analysis in Social Media! üê¶üìà

I recently completed a project that delves into the world of sentiment analysis using the Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset. This project allowed me to explore public opinion and attitudes toward specific topics and brands through the lens of social media data. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what I accomplished:

Embarking on the Analysis Journey:
Starting with data preprocessing, I carefully loaded the training and validation datasets. Renaming columns for clarity was essential, ensuring that my analysis would be straightforward and easy to interpret. I tackled missing values by removing any records with missing text‚Äîintegrity is key in data analysis!

Text Preprocessing:
The next step involved tokenization and text preprocessing. I tokenized the text, stripped away stopwords and punctuation, and lemmatized the tokens to standardize the language. This rigorous preparation set a solid foundation for the exploratory data analysis (EDA) that followed.

Exploratory Data Analysis:
During the EDA phase, I visualized the distribution of IDs and game types using bar charts. These visualizations were complemented by sentiment distributions across various games, represented through captivating bar plots and cat plots. I also utilized heatmaps to visualize any missing data, providing insights into areas for improvement.

Diving Deeper into Sentiment:
One of the highlights was conducting an entity sentiment analysis. I grouped the data by game and sentiment, analyzing the sentiment distribution for the top 10 games and entities. Creating stacked bar charts helped illustrate these trends clearly.

Additionally, I performed a common words analysis, extracting the most frequent words associated with each sentiment category. This culminated in stunning word clouds that visually represented the language used by users across different sentiments.

Model Training and Evaluation:
Moving into the modeling phase, I applied TF-IDF vectorization to convert the text data into numerical vectors, suitable for machine learning algorithms. I trained a logistic regression classifier, achieving an impressive accuracy of 82% on the validation data! The detailed classification report provided insights into precision, recall, and F1 scores, while a confusion matrix heatmap offered a visual representation of model performance.

Conclusion and Insights:
This project provided me with a comprehensive understanding of sentiment patterns across various topics in social media. The insights gained are invaluable for businesses and brands looking to gauge public opinion and adjust their strategies accordingly.
